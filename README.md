# ME231b-Final-Project
The overall goal of this project was to implement a state estimator for a complex system. The system was a bicycle and we wanted to implement a state estimator to track the position and heading of it as it moves. Two approaches were defined by using an Unscented Kalman Filter and a Particle Filter.
